    "1. The potential\n",
    "    * Write a function that returns a vector (a 1D numpy array) holding a parabola. The parabola should be centered in the middle of your vector. The function should take the curvature of the parabola and the length of the vector as arguments. Plot an example result. \n",
    "    * Write a function that returns a parametric potential landscape. I recommend zero potential in most places, and barriers and valleys with a height or depth of ~1/10. The sole argument to the function should be the spatial resolution. I have created something like this: <img src=\"example_potential.png\" width=\"400\">Plot an example result. \n",
    "2. The wave packet\n",
    "    * Write a function that returns a complex sinusoid, modulated by a Gaussian, that is, $$(cos(2\\pi kx) + i sin(2\\pi kx))\\exp(-(x-\\mu)^2/2/\\sigma^2)$$The function should take the following arguments: number of discretization points; and location, standard deviation relative to your potential landscape (that is, $\\in[0, 1]$); and the wave number $k$. You may ignore normalization constants. While numpy understands complex numbers, I have preferred to explicitly represent the real and imaginary parts.  Plot an example result. \n",
    "3. Integrating the TDSE\n",
    "    * Really, it's just a loop and two lines of code. Use circular convolution to let your wave packet live on a ring. I have used the following parameters: $\\sigma \\sim0.02, k < 30$, spatial resolution $> 400, $ time step $<1/2$. \n",
    "    * Store all intermediate results, make suitable plots of the temporal evolution. \n",
    "    * Marvel at visual quantum mechanics, implemented all by yourself! \n",
    "    * Repeat with different potential. \n",
    "    * Now try and break it: see what happens when you make the temporal or spatial discretization too coarse, when you inject too much energy into the system, etc. "
